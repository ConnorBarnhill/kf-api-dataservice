"""
A config file used to drive the transformation from csv to dict
Each csv row in the csv file will be transformed into a single dict

Each key in mappings_dict must match the name of the table_name of
entity to be loaded.

Each entity dict in mappings_dict has a set of keys that must match
the attributes of the entity's SQLAlchemy model.

The values of these keys can be set to the following:
    - a dict specifying which column in the csv row to lookup the value
        Use {COL_NAME: <name of col in input csv>}
    - a constant value
        Use {COL_VALUE: <constant value>}
    - a constant value that will be mapped to another value via the provided
    dict (see participant gender as an example)
        Use {COL_NAME: <name of col in input csv>,
            COL_VALUE: {<a potential value in the input csv>: <mapped value>,
                        <a potential value in the input csv>: <mapped value>}}

Every entity in mappings_dict must specify which column should be used to
uniquely identify the records in the table. Specify the unique columns like
this:
    "_unique_id_col": {COL_VALUE: <name of column in original table>}

Links - Every entity must specify its parent entities using links.
For example, participant has two parent entities: study and family. Thus,
in the participant mapping, two links must be specified.

A link is defined with the following format:

"_links": {
    '<name of Kids First Entity>': {
        'target_fk_col': {COL_VALUE: '<name of foreign key in KF entity>'},
        'source_fk_col': {COL_NAME: '<name of col in source csv>'}
    }
}

COL_VALUE = "$col_value"
